# Rasputin frontend

The following instructions will help you to configure your local repository for frontend development.

## Development

Install the necessary node packages.

```
npm install
```

Frontend development is done with ng-serve. Changes will be updated automatically.

```
npm run ng-serve
```

I advice to run a mock backend too.  
Open a new terminal and run a json server.

```
npm run json-server
```
